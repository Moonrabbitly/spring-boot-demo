In a Spring application, the @Autowired annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into your classes. You don't need to use @Autowired for every constructor or field if there's only one constructor. However, if you have multiple constructors, you should use @Autowired to indicate which constructor Spring should use for dependency injection.

In your code, it appears that you have multiple constructors in your ProductController class, each taking a different service as a parameter. If you want Spring to use one of these constructors for dependency injection, you should annotate the constructor you want to use with @Autowired. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:


@Controller
public class ProductController {

    private final BookService bookService;
    private final BoardGameService boardGameService;

    @Autowired
    public ProductController(BookService bookService) {
        this.bookService = bookService;
        this.boardGameService = null; // Initialize the other service if needed
    }

    @Autowired
    public ProductController(BoardGameService boardGameService) {
        this.boardGameService = boardGameService;
        this.bookService = null; // Initialize the other service if needed
    }

    // Your controller methods here...
}

In the example above, we've annotated both constructors with @Autowired. This means that Spring will use constructor-based injection to determine which service to inject based on the type of the argument provided when creating the ProductController bean.

However, note that having multiple constructors with @Autowired can be ambiguous if Spring cannot determine which one to use based on the provided arguments. In such cases, you may need to use qualifiers or other techniques to disambiguate the injection.

Alternatively, if you want to use field-based injection, you can remove the constructors and annotate the fields directly:

@Controller
public class ProductController {

    @Autowired
    private BookService bookService;

    @Autowired
    private BoardGameService boardGameService;

    // Your controller methods here...
}

In this case, Spring will automatically inject the dependencies into the fields without the need for constructors. Choose the approach that best fits your application's design and requirements.
