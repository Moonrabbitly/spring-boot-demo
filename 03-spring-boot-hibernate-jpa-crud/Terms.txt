DAO - Date Access Object
The DAO interface serves as an abstraction or contract for accessing the data source. 
It defines a set of methods that represent CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other data access operations that need to be performed on the data source. 
The actual implementation of these methods can vary depending on the data source (e.g., relational database, NoSQL database, file system).

Entity Manager
The EntityManager is a central interface in Java Persistence API (JPA), 
which provides an abstraction for managing the lifecycle of entities in a JPA-based application. 
It is part of the JPA specification and is used to interact with the underlying relational database and perform various database operations.
