SQL Scripts for prod, bunch of questions

Hi Guys,

I have some questions according to this video:

1. If I have github account and I create app to show off to my future employer, where should I put prod ddl sql scripts to do this as much professional as I can? In different github project?

You can simply put them in a separate folder in your project. Similar to the "sql-scripts" directory that we use. You can use any directory name ... just don't place the files in the resources directory. Spring will scan for anything in the resources directory.

2. By DBA do you mean Db Admin?

Yes

3. Now my apps runs sql scripts using schema.sql and data.sql in resources dir which hibernate runs automatically after application start. As I understand this is not recommended way too, right?

I would avoid using this approach in Production environments. It is good for dev/test but you have to be very careful in Production environments. Like I mentioned in the video, if you make a configuration error, you couple affect your Production database tables.

4. I created new app. I didn't use spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto entry in application.properties but my app created tables despite this. Is there any default strategy for this mechanism? I didn't added any entry in application.properties besides db url, user and password. I didn't run any sql scripts too. Some of my java classes uses @Entity annotation

5. Is it ok to use spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate in prod?
Same answer as #3.

In general, be careful when using auto-generation techniques. Be sure you thoroughly test this and understand the implications of the configuration and sql files.

I showed this example of auto-generating because it is a FAQ. However, just beware. You don't want to be the person who deletes Production data.
